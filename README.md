# Pre-work - *ListKeeper*

**ListKeeper** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Manisha Roy Choudhury**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items 
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] The todo items are sorted based on priority and are color coded
* [ ] Instead of using a dialog, the same add_task activity is used for adding a new task as well as editing a task
* [ ] In the edit page, you can update the todo date, though it is not displayed in the listview
